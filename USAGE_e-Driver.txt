In order to reproduce the results from the original publication you need the 5 files in
this folder:

- e-Driver.pl
- binomial_e-Driver.r
- ensembl_sequences_72_37.txt
- mut_data_and_tissue_info.txt
- interfaces_human_genome.txt

Simply put, you need to run the following command in a terminal from the directory where
these files are located:

perl e-Driver.pl 2 mut_data_and_tissue_info.txt interfaces_human_genome.txt ensembl_sequences_72_37.txt OUTPUT_FILE_ROOT

Where OUTPUT_FILE_ROOT is the name that you want to give to your analysis. For example, 
if you ran the previous command with "analysis_samples_1" instead of OUTPUT_FILE_ROOT
you should find new files in the directory:

- One file called: "analysis_samples_1_perl_output.txt"
- N files following the format: "analysis_samples_1_(tissue)_with_corrected_pvalues.txt"

The first file (*_perl_output.txt) is a tab-separated file that contains the raw numbers
used for the analysis of each protein region. The file has 7 columns:

1 - Tissue: the tissue of origin of the mutations (Pancan refers to the aggregate of all tissues)
2 - Protein: The protein ID that contains the region
3 - The interface being studied
4 - The number of mutations in the interface
5 - The total number of mutations in the structure
6 - The length (aa) of the interface
7 - The length of the whole structure

The other files contain the actual analysis (the output of the Rscript) and are formated
just as the *_perl_output.txt file but with two additional columns. The second to last
column contains the raw p value of the binomial test, while the last column contains the
FDR-adjusted q values.

ANALYZING YOUR OWN DATA
#######################

In order to analyze your own data you will need 3 files:

- A file with the protein sequences (the equivalent to "ensembl_sequences_72_37.txt")
- A file with the protein interfaces annotations (equivalent to "features_human_genome.txt")
- A file with the missense mutations in your samples (equivalent to "mut_data_and_tissue_info.txt")

If you map your mutations/regions to ENSEMBL proteins (v72) you can reuse the files provided
here, otherwise it's better to generate all 3 files for your project

-PROTEIN SEQUENCE FILE-

This file needs to have two columns separated by a tab space. The first column should be
the name of the protein (mind the isoforms) and the second one the actual protein
sequence. There should be only one protein per line

Example:

PROTEIN_NAME_1	AMHSTLREFGHIKLVVVVALKM

-REGION ANNOTATIONS FILE-

This file is, again, tab separated. Each line contains the region annotations for a single
protein. The first column needs to be the protein name (it should be the same as for the
protein sequence file). The rest of the line can contain as many regions as you want
(separated by tab spaces), but they all should be in the format REGION_NAME-START-END
where REGION_NAME is the name of the region (e.g. PF00069, but it can actually be whatever
want), START is the position where the region starts and END is the position where the
region ends. e-Driver counts the first aminoacid of a protein as position "1", not "0".
Note that there is no problem with overlaping regions.

Example:

PROTEIN_NAME_1	REG1-2-43	REG2-50-65	REG3-15-53

-MUTATIONS FILE-

This file is also tab-separated. Each line contains the information of a missense mutation
found in one patient. Lines have 4 different columns. 

1 - The protein name: It should respect the protein names used in the other files
2 - The position of the mutation within the protein: Note that e-Driver uses only point 
missense mutations. Note also, again, that the first aminoacid of a protein should be "1",
not "0".
3 - The ID of the patient where the mutation was found
4 - The tissue of origin of the sample

Example:

PROTEIN_NAME_1	35	PATIENT1	Pancreas
